Chopsticks is a Game developed for Languages and Web Technologies University course.

## Rules

The game is played by two players. Each player starts with on finger on each hand. The goal is to eliminate the opponent by attacking their fingers. A player can attack the opponent by using one of their fingers to touch one of the opponent's fingers. If the opponent's finger is left with a total of five points, it is considered dead and cannot be used anymore. If one of the player's hand is dead and the other on has an even amount of fingers, the player can split the fingers equally between the two hands.
The game ends when one of the players has both of their fingers dead.
